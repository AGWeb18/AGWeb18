- 👋 Hi, I’m @AGWeb18 and grateful that you stopped by. 
- 👀 I’m interested in using creativity and problem solving to simplify complex problems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about using authenticated APIs for scripting/bots and learning more about graph databases.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python or Power Platform consulting projects and building end to end pipelines for decision making.
